1) new player comes so i go master sheet check their gr and uf. i will find an active player whos also played 5s already with stats and elo
2) i put them the elo that the similar people have in ranks
...
3) after tour and stats BEFORE eloscrape i go master sheet and check their stats. then i open the logic.txt and check where i would put them. i edit in challonge participant their elo to what i want it to be
4) i also check people who have fresh elo (mainly if its their second tour and i put elo based on first one) and check based on logic.txt if i should change their elo accordingly and same way change in challonge participants
