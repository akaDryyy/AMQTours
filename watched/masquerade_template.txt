After you created your account fill out this sheet to let me know your ALTs name.

Important: Make sure you are hiding your list and the checkmark on "show scores" is also turned off. Leave the share entries on.

# Masquerade:

For the ones who dont know what masquerade is: You basically create an alt account and play your normal watched game without ppl knowing who u are. 
At the end of the tour it gets revealed who was who. The captains can decide which tiers they want to use for their players. 
No hinting about your identity to other players is allowed obviously.

# Real Masquerade variant:

You will be playing 25 songs DNGM instead, where you fully play out the songs and then tally up all your team scores.
During this tour your primary objective will be unmasking your opponets, while cooperating with your team, which will be revealed to your captain at tour start.

At tour end your captain will be asked to compile a form with your findings, you will receive points based on the number of players you will guess collectively.
After this first phase stats will be revealed and you will be able to guess again but for half the points.

# Points
- Game win: 1 point
- Game tie: 0.5 points
- Correctly guessing a player: 1 point 
- Correctly guessing a player after stats: 0.5 points

Please sign up only if you are sure to play the full length, as subs might be hard to handle.
Any feedback is welcome, as this is the first time hosting this new format.
Hope you will have fun!
