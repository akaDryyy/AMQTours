Important: Make sure you are hiding your list and the checkmark on "show scores" is also turned off. Leave the share entries on.

Masquerade:

For the ones who dont know what masquerade is: You basically create an alt account and play your normal ngmc watched game without ppl knowing who u are. 
At the end of the tour it gets revealed who was who. The captains can decide which tiers they want to use for their players. 
No hinting about your identity to your team or other players is allowed obviously.
